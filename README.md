# Operating Systems
This repository holds all projects from my Operating Systems class. Currently a WIP as I am currently still taking this course.

[exercise-1](https://github.com/novak727/Operating-Systems/tree/main/exercise-1) was a basic exercise for being able to SSH into our CS linux server and some basic commands, including editing a file through the terminal.
