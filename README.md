# Operating Systems
This repository holds all projects from my Operating Systems class. Currently a WIP as I am currently still taking this course.

[exercise-1](https://github.com/novak727/Operating-Systems/tree/main/exercise-1) was a basic exercise for being able to SSH into our CS linux server and some basic commands, including editing a file through the terminal.
sysprog1.cpp provides basic system information.

The C++ programs were written with OpenBSD in mind.

# C++ Installation and Usage
The programs in this repository can be executed using the C++ language and the g++ compiler.

g++ for [Windows](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/), don't forget to add the binary to your [path environment variable](https://www.architectryan.com/2018/03/17/add-to-the-path-on-windows-10/).

g++ can be installation on Linux using your favorite package manager.

### Run from the command line

1. Find the location of the files you want to execute.
2. Copy the path.
3. Go to the command line and run the following:
  ```sh
   cd /path/to/files
   ```

## Compile and Execute
Compile the program:
```sh
g++ program-name.cpp
```

Execute the program in Windows:
```sh
a.exe
```

Execute the program in Linux/Mac:
```sh
./a.out
```
